abstract = {In multi-tenant systems, the CPU overhead of distributed file systems (DFSes) is increasingly
a burden to application performance. CPU and memory interference cause degraded and
unstable application and storage performance, in particular for operation latency.
Recent client-local DFSes for persistent memory (PM) accelerate this trend. DFS offload
to SmartNICs is a promising solution to these problems, but it is challenging to fit
the complex demands of a DFS onto simple SmartNIC processors located across PCIe.We
present LineFS, a SmartNIC-offloaded, high-performance DFS with support for client-local
PM. To fully leverage the SmartNIC architecture, we decompose DFS operations into
execution stages that can be offloaded to a parallel datapath execution pipeline on
the SmartNIC. LineFS offloads CPU-intensive DFS tasks, like replication, compression,
data publication, index and consistency management to a Smart-NIC. We implement LineFS
on the Mellanox BlueField Smart-NIC and compare it to Assise, a state-of-the-art PM
DFS. LineFS improves latency in LevelDB up to 80% and throughput in Filebench up to
79%, while providing extended DFS availability during host system failures.},
